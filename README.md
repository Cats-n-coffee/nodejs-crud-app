# Pure NODEJS CRUD app

This project is an exercise using NodeJs without any framework and minimal libraries. 
The goal was to get a deeper understanding of NodeJs, and all the mechanisms involved in creating a CRUD app (CORS, using request body data, ...).
This backend is a REST API working with a frontend in a different repository().

## Code organization

## Routing

## Using request body data (no body-parser library)

## Solving CORS issues (no CORS library)

## Performing DB operations (MongoDb Native drivers)

## Encrypting passwords (using crypto module)
